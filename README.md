How does the employment of people in San Mateo County California compare to the state of California?

Looking at the U.S. Census data for 2017, San Mateo County is near the heart of Silicon Valley and the type of industries where people are employed reflect the emphasis on High Tech jobs as compared to the state as a whole.  The percent of workers in the Professional, Scientific, & Technical Services industry is 14% in San Mateo County, but only 7% in California as a whole.  Similarly, the Information Sector has over twice the percentage of workers in SMC as there are in California as a whole.
