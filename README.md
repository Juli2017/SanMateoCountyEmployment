Project for MOOC Data Visualization for Storytelling and Discovery

U.S. Census data were visualized to compare the distribution of employment in San Mateo County

Looking at the U.S. Census data for 2017, San Mateo County is near the heart of Silicon Valley and the type of industries where people are employed reflect the emphasis on High Tech jobs as compared to the state as a whole.  The percent of workers in the Professional, Scientific, & Technical Services industry is 14% in San Mateo County, but only 7% in California as a whole.  Similarly, the Information Sector has over twice the percentage of workers in SMC as there are in California as a whole.

It is clear that the Professional, Scientific, & Technical Services (NCAIS code 54, PSTS) shows the most dramatic increase in employees over time for this time frame.  At the same time that the other sectors show a decline, fluctuate around the same number of employees, or show moderate gains in employees, the PSTS and Information sectors have increased dramatically.  The PSTS Industry code includes: computer program or software development, computer software support services, computer software consulting services, computer hardware consulting services, information management computer systems, computer-aided design services, etc.
