San Mateo County (SMC) is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, between the heart of Silicon Valley in Santa Clara County and San Francisco County.  The change over time in which industries employ the majority of workers in the county reflects the recent emphasis on High Tech jobs in this part of the state.  Even for the latest year of data, compred to the state as a whole , the percent of workers in the Professional, Scientific, & Technical Services industry is 14% in San Mateo County, but only 7% in California.  Similarly, the Information Sector has over twice the percentage of workers in SMC as there are in California.

There has been a dramatic change in the relative importance of different industries in San Mateo County in the past 25 years.
The Professional, Scientific, & Technical Services (NCAIS code 54, PSTS) and Information sectors show the most dramatic increases in number of employees over time for this time frame.

Visualizing the percent change by sector in number of employees over time, relataive to the number in 1992, it is striking that the top 3 industries in 1992 (Retail Trade, Manufacturing, Transportation and Warehousing) were not part of the job growth as seen in 2017.  The Information sector, though showing an over 300% growth rate, showed much more volatility over time.

It looks as though there is a bias towards male employees in the middle age groups for the PSTS industry.
