San Mateo County (SMC) is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, between the heart of Silicon Valley in Santa Clara County and San Francisco County.  The change over time in which industries employ the majority of workers in the county reflects the recent emphasis on High Tech jobs in this part of the state.  Even for the latest year of data, compred to the state as a whole , the percent of workers in the Professional, Scientific, & Technical Services industry is 14% in San Mateo County, but only 7% in California.  Similarly, the Information Sector has over twice the percentage of workers in SMC as there are in California.
